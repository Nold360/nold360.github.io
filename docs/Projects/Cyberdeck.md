# My Cyberdeck Build

I'm a big long time cyberpunk fan even before reading Neuromancer. After getting addicted to mechanical keyboards and building many portable gaming consoles, it was time I finally build my own cyberdeck!

The deck is supposed to be a portable computer like a notebook. Small but usable. The GPIO & other external interfaces of the SBC [Single Board Computers] should all be accessable from the outside. For the keyboard there is only one option, a mechanical one. Preferable a custom build, or something in the 60% to 40% area. A mouse is optinal but a trackball would be benefitial.



## Components

|    Part     |          Description           |  Status  |
|-------------|--------------------------------|----------|
| [Rock Pi N10](https://wiki.radxa.com/RockpiN10) | Powerfull SBC to drive my deck | Ordered  |
| [HD702E LCD](https://www.friendlyarm.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=230)  | 7" Display with eDP interface | Arrived  |
| [JJ50](https://kprepublic.com/products/jj50-50-custom-keyboard-pcb-similar-with-preonic)  | Small mechanical keyboard | Ordered  |
| [Trackball](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/trackball-breakout) | The Pimoroni Trackball Breakout seems like a good option | todo |
| Batteries   | Depends on the space i have in the case | todo |
| [RetroPSU](https://www.heldergametech.com/shop/gameboy-zero/retropsu/) | Helder's RetroPSU seems like a good battery management solution | Ordered  |


## Case 

I will design the case from scratch in fusion 360 and will be made open source if it turns out good.



## Custom PCBs

### eDP Adapter

To match the eDP interface of the Rock Pi N10 to the display, i'll need to design a custom PCB. The design is already done & ready for manifacturing using JLCPCB.
