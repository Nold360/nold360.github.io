# Console DB

The Idea behind this Wiki is, creating an archivable, distributable and open collection of video console documentations. 

**Including:**
 - Schematics
 - Datasheets
 - Pinouts
 - PCB Scans
 - Modding & Hacking Techniqes 
 - ... and more!

What this page makes different, is it's open approche! Everything on this site is syncronized to a Git-Repository. And this is where the magic happens: The Git-Backend makes it possible for basically everybody, to clone(download), contribute changes or distribute it.

## Git Backend
Since the git repo will most become VERY big, i can't host it on Github/Gitlab/... But you can clone it from my local gittea instance: https://git.nold.in/nold.in/wiki/
